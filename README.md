An exercise done to practice the use of flexbox and general grasp of basic HTML and CSS functions.

This should be visible at https://eightfivezeroeight.github.io/fullstack-CSS-exercise/. 

The project isn't perfect, but I've reached the required milestones, and as such have spend some time configuring the CLI to properly start practicing commit messages.

The following seven elements will start to be used from here on:
    1. Separate subject from body with blank line.
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
    3. Capitalize the subject line.
    4. Do not end the subject line with a period.
    5. Use imperative mood in the subject line.
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
    7. Use the body to explain what and why vs how.
        * Don't explain how a change was made; code is generally self-explanatory. Instead amke claer the reason why you made the change in the first place -- how things worked before, how they do now, and why you changed it.
